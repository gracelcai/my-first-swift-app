## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### My Favorite Apps
- Spotify
    - Creating playlists with friends
    - Music recommendations
- Pinterest
    - Organizing pins into boards
    - Shopping for items in pins

    - Can input specific pick up and drop off locations
    - Rating Uber drivers
### My App Idea
I want to make an app to keep track of  workouts. The main feature would be to input different exercises such as barbell squats with additional information about how many sets/reps the user can complete and how much weight they can lift. The app would track a user's progress and recommend workout routines. Users would also be able to share workout progress and routines and participate in a friendly competition to motivate each other to be more active.
## Notes

Some buttons in XCode were hard to find such as "Adjust Editor Options".
